# HTML Basics

![A Letter by Einstein](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Einstein_Szilard_p1.jpg)

???
What is this? A letter. You know because you've learned this, you've seen plenty of them before.

---

# What are the parts of a letter?

---
count: false

# What are the parts of a letter?

- Heading
- Greeting
- Body
- Salutation

???
You also know this, because you learned this.
Time for a weird question:

---

# .eight[Does the paper know what these parts are?]

---
count: false

# .eight[Does the paper know what these parts are?]

# Of course not!

???
Our conventions tell us where to put these parts on the paper and in what order, but that's it.

---

# Now let's imagine that letter as a web page.

# .eight[Does the computer know what these parts are?]

---
class: middle, center

# .eleven[Only if you tell it.]

---
class: middle, center

![But Why?](http://i.imgur.com/Br00TCn.gif)

???
What do you think? Why would a computer need to know the parts of a letter?

---
class: middle, center

# Unlike paper, the computer stores the letter data AND has to display it.

???
Those two things are separate actions.

---
class: middle, center

# .eight[Semantics]

???
Philosophic question about what a thing is. Not what it is made of. Not how it is used. But why it exists.

---

# HTML is a Specification

- [Read it](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) if you want, it's boring.
- A specification is an agreed upon way for:
  - You to write it 
  - Browsers to display it

---

# HTML 5

- Newest version of the spec
- Plenty of older versions
- Every web page needs to .eight[declare] it's version

---
class: middle

# `<!DOCTYPE html>`

???
This isn't a tag. It's a document declaration.
Back in the day, everything on the web was a document.
Not declaring a valid doctype will get you into "quirks" mode.

# .eight[Everything else is Tags!!!]

---
class: middle, center

![Anatomy of a Tag](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/7659/anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

???
Pair of Angle Brackets + Tag Name + Optional Attributes.
Open vs Closing tag is just the slash. No attributes in closing tags.
Think of this as closing the lid on your box.

---

# Attributes

- Modify the tag's default behavior
- Provide more information about it.

???
Like command line flags.

---
class: middle, center

# Attributes always come in name/value pairs

# .eight[name="value"] 

---

# Examples

# .eight[id="unique-identifier"]
# .eight[href="some-link.com"]
# .eight[checked]

---
count: false

# Examples

# .eight[id="unique-identifier"]
# .eight[href="some-link.com"]
# .eight[checked]="checked"

---
class: middle, center

# A tag without attributes still has attributes.

# .eight[Default Attributes]

???
Different for each tag, occasionally different across browsers.
Remember the spec is just a set of rules, no one enforces them.

---

# Attributes

- Can be in any order.
- Only in the opening tag.

---

# Tags vs. Elements

- The .eight[Tag] creates the .eight[Element]
- Tags -> Source Code
- Elements -> Display

???
Written input vs. rendered output.

---

# DOM

- Document Object Model
- An outline of your elements rendered on screen
- Eventually, we'll learn to manipulate the DOM

---
class: middle, center

![DOM Outline](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190m/07sp/lectures/slides/images/dom.png)

???
Think of your web page like an outline, each item is called a node.

# Nesting Elements

- Wrapping content with a tag creates .eight[meaning]
- Wrapping tags with tags creates .eight[organization]

# It's important for you to know the spec, but .eight[more important] to know how different browsers interpret that spec.
